3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

1. **Daily Trend for Orders**: A bar chart showing the number of orders placed each day of the week.
2. **Hourly Trend for Total Orders**: A line chart displaying the number of orders placed during each hour of the day.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: A pie chart showing the percentage of total sales attributed to each pizza category.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: A pie chart representing the percentage of sales for different pizza sizes.
